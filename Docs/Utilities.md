## Freezable

This is a lightweight implementation of the Freezable class. A freezable class is initially freely modifiable, but can be made read-only with freezing it.
The IFreezable interface describes a freezable class, the FreezableBase abstract class is a good base for freezable classes.

### Example

	public abstract class MyFreezable : FreezableBase
	{
	    private string _data;
	    public string Data
	    {
	        get { return _data; }
	        set
	        {
	            // This method will throw ReadonlyException if the object's Freeze() method was called.
	            ThrowIfFrozen();
	            _data= value;
	        }
	    }
	}


## Extensions

Various extension methods that enhance built-in functionality. Don't forget to add the `using Piedone.HelpfulLibraries.Utilities;` declaration to your code to use (most of) these.

### Examples

Here, we show usage examples for most of the extension methods.

#### CacheServiceMonitor
```csharp
// _cacheService is an injected Orchard.Caching ICacheService.
var value = _cacheService.Get<MyClass>("key", () => 
{
	// If the event is triggered the entry for the cache key will be removed. It will work otherwise too, but it's
	// better to call Monitor() only when the cache entry is created newly.
	_cacheService.Monitor("event key", "cache key");

	// ...
});

// Removes all cache entries that were subscribed to the specified event.
_cacheService.Trigger("event key");
// You can use the above to invalidate multiple cache entries at once: when they Monitor the same event key, triggering
// the event will remove all of the cache entries.
```
	
#### HqlQueryExtensions
```csharp
// From a Projector IFilterProvider.
public void ApplyFilter(FilterContext context)
{
	IEnumerable<int> ids = ...
	// Applies the IN() in partitions of given size so the maximal number of IN() arguments isn't an issue.
	context.Query.WhereIdIn(ids);
}
```

#### HqlExpressionFactoryExtensions
... contains extensions to use such partitioned clauses in a generic way.

#### ShapeDisplayingContextExtensions
```csharp
public class ShapeHider : ShapeDisplayEvents
{
	public override void Displaying(ShapeDisplayingContext context)
	{
		// ...
		context.HideShape();
	}
}
```

#### StorageProviderExtensions
```csharp
// Getting the directory separator used by an injected IStorageProvider:
var directorySeparator = _storageProvider.GetDirectorySeparator();
```

#### UriExtensions
```csharp
var urlWithoutSchema = new Uri("http://orchardproject.net").ToStringWithoutScheme();
```
	
#### WebViewPageExtensions
```razor
if (this.WasNotDisplayed("myKey"))
{
	// Display something that should only be displayed once, no matter how many times the view is rendered
}

// Usable in views, similar to the built-in Capture() method.
@using (this.CaptureOnce())
{
	// This will be included in the resulting html markup only once, no matter how many times the block is run.
}
```

See [this blogpost](https://english.orchardproject.hu/blog/making-sure-your-inline-script-is-only-incuded-once-when-multiple-content-items-are-listed) for a sample usage of CaptureOnce().


## MappingsManager

Service for managing ORM mappings, particularly for clearing NHibernate mappings by deleting mappings.bin. Can be useful if you want to use new mappings immediately their update (e.g. inside a migration).

	_mappingsManager.Clear(); // _mappingsManager is an injected IMappingsManager instance


## MimeAssistant

A simple helper for determining the MIME type of a file, depending on its extension. Its code is taken from a [SO post](http://stackoverflow.com/a/7161265/220230).

	var mime = MimeAssistant.GetMimeType("test.jpg"); // image/jpeg

## OrchardVersion

The following code returns the version of the currently executing Orchard application.

	var version = OrchardVersion.Current();
 
## UriHelper

Combines uri segments with forward slashes (much like Path.Combine() for local paths).

	var uri = UriHelper.Combine("sub", "folder"); // Returns sub/folders


## LocalizerDependency

ILocalizerDependency can be used to inject a Localizer through ctor injection (instead of the usual property injection) or to enable explicit Resolve<T>()-ing of it.

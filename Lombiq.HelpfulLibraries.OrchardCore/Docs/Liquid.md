# Lombiq Helpful Libraries - Orchard Core Libraries - Liquid for Orchard Core

Contains supplementary extensions and services for using Liquid in Orchard Core.

## The `ILiquidPropertyRegistrar` service interface

Implement this to define Liquid properties that rely on other services and async resolution. This way you can save a lot of boilerplate and inject services the usual way.

Note: Use `services.RegisterLiquidPropertyAccessor<TImplementation>(propertyName)` instead of `services.AddScoped()`. That's handled by the extension.

## Extensions

- `LiquidServiceCollectionExtensions`: Used for registering related services, like `RegisterLiquidPropertyAccessor()` to register new properties.

# Lombiq Helpful Libraries - Orchard Core Libraries - Security

## Extensions

- `SecurityOrchardCoreBuilderExtensions`: Adds `BuilderExtensions` extensions. For example, the `ConfigureSecurityDefaults()` that provides some default security configuration for Orchard Core.

There is a similar section for security extensions related to ASP.NET Core [here](../../Lombiq.HelpfulLibraries.AspNetCore/Docs/Security.md).

These extensions provide additional security and can resolve issues reported by the [ZAP security scanner](https://github.com/Lombiq/UI-Testing-Toolbox/blob/dev/Lombiq.Tests.UI/Docs/SecurityScanning.md).

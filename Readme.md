### Libraries

The module consists of the following independent libraries (all in their own features):

- [Authentication Libraries](Docs/AuthenticationLibraries.md)
- [Contents Libraries](Docs/ContentsLibraries.md)
- [Dependency Injection Libraries](Docs/DependencyInjectionLibraries.md)
- [Key Value Store](Docs/KeyValueStore.md)
- [Parallel Extensions Extras](Docs/ParallelExtensionsExtras.md) is an exception, as it isn't a feature
- [Serialization Libraries](Docs/SerializationLibraries.md)
- [Service Validation Libraries](Docs/ServiceValidationLibraries.md)
- [Tasks Libraries](Docs/TasksLibraries.md)
- [Utilities](Docs/Utilities.md)

You can use these libraries as described on the above pages. Don't forget to add a reference to the Piedone.HelpfulLibraries project from your project. Also correctly list the feature of the used libraries as a dependency in your module's Module.txt.  
Public APIs are always documented so please always read method comments.

The module is also available for [DotNest](http://dotnest.com/) sites.

**See the [Version history](Docs/VersionHistory.md).**

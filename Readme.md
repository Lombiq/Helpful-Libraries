## About

Various useful libraries that can be handy when developing for .NET, ASP.NET Core, and [Orchard Core](https://orchardcore.net/), to be used from your own projects.

Do you want to quickly try out this project and see it in action? Check it out in our [Open-Source Orchard Core Extensions](https://github.com/Lombiq/Open-Source-Orchard-Core-Extensions) full Orchard Core solution and also see our other useful Orchard Core-related open-source projects!

Note that this project has an Orchard 1 version in the [dev-orchard-1 branch](https://github.com/Lombiq/Helpful-Libraries/tree/dev-orchard-1).


## Documentation

Helpful Libraries consists of the following independent libraries (all in their own projects/packages). Use the one specific to your use-case, or all at once by depending on `Lombiq.HelpfulLibraries`.

- [ASP.NET Core Libraries](Lombiq.HelpfulLibraries.AspNetCore/Readme.md)
- [Command Line Libraries](Lombiq.HelpfulLibraries.Cli/Readme.md)
- [Common Libraries](Lombiq.HelpfulLibraries.Common/Readme.md)
- [LINQ to DB Libraries for Orchard Core](Lombiq.HelpfulLibraries.LinqToDb/Readme.md)
- [Orchard Core Libraries](Lombiq.HelpfulLibraries.OrchardCore/Readme.md)
- [RestEase Libraries for Orchard Core](Lombiq.HelpfulLibraries.RestEase/Readme.md)

Public APIs are always documented so please always read method comments.

Check out the [`Lombiq.HelpfulLibraries.Samples` project](Lombiq.HelpfulLibraries.Samples) for various examples in the form of an Orchard Core module.

Note: The `Lombiq.HelpfulLibraries.sln` file exists to provide centralized building of the independent library projects but otherwise you don't need to use it.
